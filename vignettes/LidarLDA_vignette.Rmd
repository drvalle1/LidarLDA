We start by showing how to fit the model based on simulated data with 5 clusters. The simulated datasets contain information for 2,000 pixels (rows) and 50 height bins (columns), labeled z1, z2, ..., z50. 

The data in `sim_y5` consist of the number of returned light pulses whereas the data in `sim_n5` consist of the number of incoming light pulses, in each pixel and height bin. As a result, `sim_y5` is always smaller or equal to `sim_n5`.

```{r setup}
library(LidarLDA)


```


```{r }
